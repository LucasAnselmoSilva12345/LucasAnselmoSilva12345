# Hi, welcome to my GitHub Profile! üëã

## Resume about me üë¶

My name is Lucas Anselmo, I've 21 age, and in addition to being a computer science student (currently in the 8th period of the course), I work with application and software development, with an emphasis on the visual development of products, that is, I am a Front-end developer.

As a front-end developer, I created several personal projects, created and developed based on my studies on web development and all its present technologies. As a developer, I use the JavaScript ‚Äúfamily‚Äù as my helper to study and develop with it, so I use **JavaScript, React, TypeScript and NextJS** to create a web application and increase my portfolio. In addition to developing personal projects, I also contributed to ‚Äúfree software‚Äù projects, also known as ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù. The software in question was the Open Journal System, in its version 3.3.

I leave as a reference here, my profile on GitHub, where my personal projects are hosted, and, as a highlight, I leave the suggestion for viewing the projects:
