Hello, I'm Lucas Anselmo, 22 years old. I am a computer technician and hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I graduated as a technician from ETEC Martinho Di Ciero and as a bachelor from the Federal Institute of S√£o Paulo, Salto Campus.

I am constantly seeking new opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to innovative projects. My focus is on developing responsive, accessible applications with excellent usability, meeting the needs of all users.

## Professional experiences üóÇÔ∏è

I began my professional career in August 2021 as a web software development intern, working on the visual and structural creation of academic journals for universities and institutions in the fields of social and cultural sciences, as well as open access projects. In January 2024, I took on the role of Junior Programmer Analyst at the commercial website "Sof√° Na Caixa." In this role, in addition to analytical responsibilities, I lead the site's development team, coordinating all related projects and initiatives.
